# NOTICE

This binary embeds two pre-trained OCR models:

- `models/text-detection.rten`
- `models/text-recognition.rten`

They are the ocrs models by Robert Knight, from
[robertknight/ocrs-models](https://github.com/robertknight/ocrs-models) and
[huggingface.co/robertknight/ocrs](https://huggingface.co/robertknight/ocrs), licensed
**CC-BY-SA-4.0** (Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0,
<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>).

The models are redistributed unmodified under that licence with attribution. They are confined to
this helper binary, which `host-reference` runs at arm's length over the command line (`call/0033`,
`call/0034`), so the permissive `host-reference-ocr` plugin and its dependents are an aggregation with
the models rather than a derivative of them. This repository's own source is under the Unlicense (see
`LICENSE`).
